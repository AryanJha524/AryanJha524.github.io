      <h2>whoami() - 11/04/2025</h2>
      <p>
        hello im aryan, im 24, been an sde @ aws for 2ish years, part-time
        masters student @ georgia tech for almost a year. i graduated in 2023
        with a bachelors in cs from ucf. why am i doing a masters if i already
        have a job? kinda just for fun and mostly because i missed learning in a
        structured format. i wanted to learn more about ML and AI, as well as
        some specialized courses like high performance computing architecture.
        going through the program gives me a structured way of learning which
        works for me. i wasn't super passionate about computer science/software
        development/programming when i was deciding my major. i just picked it
        because 2 of my friends that were older than me did it. but i got into
        it my sophomore year after a DSA class. around the same time, i got this
        idea of wanting to work in big tech and spent a lot of time interview
        prepping and was fortunate enough to get an internship and return offer.
        <br />
        after joining aws - i started to learn a ton and still am. recently
        though, i started to think about why i'm doing what i'm doing for work,
        and why am i a software developer? an upcoming quarter-life crisis?
        probably. i still like writing code to solve problems, i still get a
        sense of satisfaction when the code works or its well written. there's a
        few things about working at company like aws. the scale of the things
        you can build is huge but the "cog in the machine" feeling is real. the
        ownership you have is great and the engineering culture/bar is high but
        you can't always control what you are building. i came to the conclusion
        that, while i enjoy and learn from my job at aws, i don't know what i
        want to do long term in this field - but i know i want to do and build
        things i care about and learn about things i find interesting.
        <br />
        so, until i know <i>what</i> i want to do, i'm gonna try to build stuff
        and learn stuff i think is interesting and try to write about it. maybe,
        i'll find my true calling along the way (building b2b saas) or maybe i
        won't, but at least i'll be doing it for myself. part of the reason i'm
        even writing this stems from consuming too much. i've spent too much
        time watching or reading about other people make or write cool things
        instead of creating myself. i realized that that's not the way i want to
        live my life. going forward, i'm going to be creating and learning stuff
        for myself and trying to write about it on this site, sort of like a
        blog. let's see where this goes!
